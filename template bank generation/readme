Small examples for manually generating template bank.

The nonspinbank.sh file needs to be run in the shell. It employs the zero detuned high power asd(Zero_det_high_P.txt).
The resulting file is testNonSpin.xml
The screenshot of how the shell looks like after running the .sh file is shown in nonspinbank_ss.png
